# dot-files

First clone this repo onto your local machine if you don't already have it

```
git clone git@github.com:HenryDashwood/dot-files.git
```

On your local machine run the line below. Note that if your username is not `ubuntu` you will want to update the first line of `.zshrc` first.

```
sh remote_setup.sh [USERNAME] [REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS] [PRIVATE_KEY]
```

Then you can ssh in with

```
ssh [USERNAME]@[REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS]
```
